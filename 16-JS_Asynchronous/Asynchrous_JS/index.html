  <h1>Asynchronous Programming</h1>
  <h4>
    Asynchronous programming in JavaScript is a way to perform tasks without freezing your entire program.
    It's like sending a message and going about your day while waiting for a reply. 
    JavaScript uses techniques like callbacks, Promises, and async/await to make this possible.
    You can start a task, do other things, and then come back to it when it's done. 
    This helps keep your program running smoothly, 
    especially when dealing with slow tasks like loading data from the internet.

  <h4>Functions running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous.</h4>
